1. 
   It's very comman from GraphQL to be use to return many things in ONE query:
  ex: 
  {
    person {name, age, ...},
    city { name, country, ...}
  }


2. Also can return diffrent rows on the same scheme:

query MultiRowsFromSameSchema{
  person1: person(personID: "1"){
    name,
    mass
  },
  person(personID: "2") {
    name,
    mass
  }
}
   RETURN:    
             {
              "data": {
                "person1": {
                  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
                  "mass": 77
                },
                "person": {
                  "name": "C-3PO",
                  "mass": 75
                }
              }
            }


Note: bc the return of result will be a JSON we have to name diffrentntly the key of the json (BY DEFAULT THEY RECEIVED THE SAME NAME AS SCHEMA => having 2 <> rows from saem schema would => in same name.   {
              "data": {
                "person": {...},
                "person": {... }
              }
            } ) 

So we use alliases. 
aliasses is adding 
         MyAlliasName: 
         before query string
