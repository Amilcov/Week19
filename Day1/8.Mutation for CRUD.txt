Usually when ppl talk about GrapyQL they talk about fetching recors from database + CRUD operations => mutations 

1. Syntax:

    mutation {

    }
    
    
2. 

   mutation {
      mutationName (k1: "V1", k2" "V2") {
          k1,
          k2,
          association {
              id,
              name
          }
      }

    }
